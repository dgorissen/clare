# C.L.A.R.E - Come Look At Robot Entertainment

CLARE, short for Come Look At Robot Entertainment, is an interactive robot I designed together with the kids and have been working on (and still am) for quite some time. Its mostly for fun and to expose the kids to robotics but also allows me to scratch that technical itch as my professional life ventures into documents, spreadsheets, powerpoint, and meetings.

I am designing CLARE fully from scratch, including all CAD, wiring, coding, custom PCBs, etc. Printing happens on my home 3D printer and features multiple cameras, face recognition and tracking, interactive voice commands, LCD screen, LEDs, and fart detector. It can be controlled with an RC remote or (planned) move autonomously using SLAM.

This is still a work in progress and updates will come whenever I find a pocket of time.
